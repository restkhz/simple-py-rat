# simple-py-rat

A simple rat in Python.

Traffic encrypted with AES-ECB, using Diffie–Hellman key exchange to generate key. So you don’t need to manually configure a key. (Has some sort of perfect forward Secrecy?)

Tested on Linux and Windows10.

## Disclaimer

This is an example of implementing DH and AES encrypted communication in python, for learning and proof of concept purposes only.
